    Hi! I'm Zijie, a junior CS student at Zhejiang University in Turing Class. 
  </p>

  <p>
    My research interst lies in the intersection of <strong>deep generative models</strong> and <strong>AI4Sciences</strong>, 
    aiming at interpreting the biological & physical world. 
    Previously I focus on molecular design and optimization with specific constraints. 
    <strong> I hope to leverage AI to pioneer innovative therapeutics that change the world.</strong>
    <br><br>
    I was fortunate to start my research journey at <a href="https://cadd.drugflow.com/" target="_blank">CADD Lab</a> under the supervision of
    <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vHW2kqUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank">Prof. Hou Tingjun</a>. I also feel lucky to be advised by <a href="https://jianglab.bioengineering.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Prof. Jiang Kaiyi</a> from Princeton University.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm also a member of Zhejiang University Orchestra playing 🎷. I like 🏀 and I'm a fan of Leo Messi and Stephen Curry.
