    My research interst lies in the intersection of <strong>generative models</strong> and <strong>AI4Sciences</strong>, aiming at interpreting the bio & physical world to create. Previously I focus on molecular generation and optimization with specific constraints. And I'm also interested in exploring single cells and their interactions with targeted interventions.
